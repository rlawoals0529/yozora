/**
 * The palette picker.
 *
 * Design read: each option is a SPECIMEN of the palette it offers, not a label with a dot
 * beside it. You choose a theme by looking at it, so an option shows the four things that
 * actually differ between two palettes - the page ground, the panel on it, the ink, and both
 * accents - arranged the way they sit on a real page. Fifteen names beside fifteen identical
 * chips is a list you have to try one at a time.
 *
 * So trying one costs nothing: arrowing through the list applies each palette to the page as
 * you pass it, and Escape puts back the one you arrived with. That is the whole reason the
 * control exists and it is the part a disclosure full of buttons could not do.
 *
 * Three exports, because where the CHOICE lives and where the CONTROL lives are not the same
 * question. `Palette` answers both for the common case. An app that renders the picker
 * conditionally - inside a tab panel, say - must keep the choice above it with `useTheme`,
 * or unmounting the control stops the theme being applied at all.
