/**
 * Arrow keys, one tab stop, and Escape, for a palette picker built without a framework.
 *
 * The React component in palette.tsx has this behaviour built in. Two pages here are plain
 * TypeScript and cannot use it, and the behaviour is the part worth sharing: which colours a
 * page paints its swatches in is its own business, but "fifteen tab stops to get past a
 * preference" and "trying one is a one-way door" are wrong everywhere.
 *
 * The markup stays the caller's. This only reads the options out of a container and wires the
 * keys, so a page can lay them out however it likes.
 *
 *   const options = [...list.querySelectorAll<HTMLButtonElement>("button[data-theme]")];
 *   const picker = wirePalette(list, options, { select, current: () => chosen });
