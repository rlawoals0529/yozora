/**
 * Choosing a palette at runtime, and the two things that go wrong when you do not.
 *
 * The palettes are rescoped to `[data-theme]` by `vendor.mjs --picker`, so switching is one
 * attribute write. Everything below exists because of what has to happen *alongside* that write.
 *
 * **`color-scheme` is not optional.** It tells the browser which way to paint the things the
 * page does not own: scrollbars, form controls, and the canvas behind the document. Set the
 * attribute without it and a light palette gets a dark scrollbar down its side, which no amount
 * of CSS on your own elements will fix, because none of those are your elements.
 *
 * **Storage throws, it does not merely return null.** In a private window, or with site data
 * blocked, touching `localStorage` raises. A theme is a convenience; failing to read one is not
 * a reason to fail to render, so every access is guarded.
 *
 * The host is injected rather than reached for. Not for purity: it means the decisions here are
 * testable in a plain node runner, so vendoring this does not oblige five projects to add jsdom
 * for one file. What a real browser does with the result is covered where it should be, in each
 * project's own browser suite.

/**
 * The palette every page here opens on.
 *
 * A constant rather than a string each project types out, because the projects are read one
 * after another. A visitor moving between them should not get a different scheme each time -
 * that reads as unrelated pages rather than as one body of work - so this is the one part of
 * the look that is deliberately shared. Everything else about how a project looks is its own.
 *
 * It lives here because a string retyped in a dozen places is a convention, and a convention
 * is what a new project quietly breaks: two of them shipped on the wrong palette before this
 * existed, each one correct in isolation and wrong beside the others.
